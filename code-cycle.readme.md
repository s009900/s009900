# üòÅ The Developer's Code Cycle

Every developer goes through these phases when working on code. Here's a humorous take on the emotional rollercoaster of programming!

## The Three States of a Developer

<table style="border: none; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px auto; width: 100%; max-width: 800px;">
  <tr style="border: none;">
    <td align="center" style="border: none; padding: 20px;">
      <img src="good-spiral-eyes.png" width="120" alt="Broken system!"/>
      <h3>Phase 1: Something BROKE!</h3>
      <p>That moment when nothing works and you're not sure why. The code was working just a minute ago, right?</p>
    </td>
    <td align="center" style="border: none; padding: 20px;">
      <img src="good-relieved.png" width="120" alt="It's working!"/>
      <h3>Phase 2: It's FINALLY working...</h3>
      <p>After hours of debugging, the code runs! But you're too afraid to touch anything now.</p>
    </td>
    <td align="center" style="border: none; padding: 20px;">
      <img src="good-astonished.png" width="120" alt="It's working but I don't know how!"/>
      <h3>Phase 3: HOW IS IT WORKING???</h3>
      <p>The code works, but you have no idea why. You're afraid to change anything now.</p>

## The Never-Ending Cycle

1. Write some code
2. Something breaks
3. Fix the bug
4. Something else breaks
5. GOTO 1
